What is Cloud Computing? Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet

Shared responsibility model: this model is used on cloud services and states that both the cloud provider and the consumer have responsibilities regarding the CIA trinity. The exact division of responsibilities depends on the service you are using on the cloud, although the information, data, accounts, and identities are always under consumer responsibility, and security, maintenance and all other services related to the physical space and datacenters are always under the cloud provider's responsibility. The service model will determine responsibility for things like Operating systems, Network controls and Applications.

Private cloud: used by a single entity. The entity has more control over it but has to absorb a greater cost.
Public cloud: built, maintained, and controlled by a third party.
Hybrid cloud: an environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment.
Multi-cloud: it is the use of services of public cloud from different cloud providers.

Cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. You only pay for what you use. This is great because you can adapt your infrastructure accordingly to your needs at the moment.

Cloud services are known for their high availability and scalability. In terms of scalability, there are two options: vertical (machine upgrade) and horizontal (no of machines deployed)

If you want maximum control of security, infrastructure as a service provides you with physical resources but lets you manage the operating systems and installed software, including patches and maintenance. If you want patches and maintenance taken care of automatically, platform-as-a-service or software-as-a-service deployments may be the best cloud strategies for you.

There are two types of manageability for cloud computing:

 - Management of the cloud
Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:

Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

 - Management in the cloud
Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:

Through a web portal.
Using a command line interface.
Using APIs.
Using PowerShell.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is the most flexible category of cloud services, as it provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources. In an IaaS model, the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security. You’re responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration; and so on. With IaaS, you’re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you.

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service). In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases. PaaS is well suited to provide a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.

Software as a service (SaaS) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. With SaaS, you’re essentially renting or using a fully developed application. Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation. While the SaaS model may be the least flexible, it’s also the easiest to get up and running. It requires the least amount of technical knowledge or expertise to fully employ.

Physical infrastructure: Datacenters are grouped into Azure Regions or Azure Availability Zones that are designed to help achieve resiliency and reliability for business-critical workloads.

A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network.

Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.

Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography. This approach allows for the replication of resources across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect an entire region. For example, if a region in a pair was affected by a natural disaster, services would automatically fail over to the other region in its region pair.

A resource is the basic building block of Azure. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. Resource groups are simply groupings of resources. When you create a resource, you’re required to place it into a resource group. While a resource group can contain many resources, a single resource can only be in one resource group at a time. Some resources may be moved between resource groups, but when you move a resource to a new group, it will no longer be associated with the former group. Additionally, resource groups can't be nested, meaning you can’t put resource group B inside of resource group A.

In Azure, subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale. Similar to how resource groups are a way to logically organize resources, subscriptions allow you to logically organize your resource groups and facilitate billing. An account can have multiple subscriptions, but it’s only required to have one. In a multi-subscription account, you can use the subscriptions to configure different billing models and apply different access-management policies.

The final piece is the management group. If you have many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into containers called management groups and apply governance conditions to the management groups.

 * VMs:
VMs are an ideal choice when you need:
 - Total control over the operating system (OS).
 - The ability to run custom software.
 - To use custom hosting configurations.

Scale sets allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand, or you can set it to scale based on a defined schedule. Virtual machine scale sets also automatically deploy a load balancer to make sure that your resources are being used efficiently.

Virtual machine availability sets are another tool to help you build a more resilient, highly available environment. Availability sets are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power failure.

Another type of virtual machine is the Azure Virtual Desktop. Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud. It enables you to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. Azure Virtual Desktop provides centralized security management for users' desktops with Microsoft Entra ID. You can enable multifactor authentication to secure user sign-ins. You can also secure access to data by assigning granular role-based access controls (RBACs) to users. With Azure Virtual Desktop, the data and apps are separated from the local hardware. The actual desktop and apps are running in the cloud, meaning the risk of confidential data being left on a personal device is reduced. Additionally, user sessions are isolated in both single and multi-session environments.

 * Containers:
Azure Container Instances are a platform as a service (PaaS) offering. Azure Container Instances allow you to upload your containers and then the service will run the containers for you.

 * Serverless:
Azure Functions is an event-driven, serverless compute option that doesn’t require maintaining virtual machines or containers. Functions scale automatically based on demand, so they may be a good choice when demand is variable. Azure Functions runs your code when it's triggered and automatically deallocates resources when the function is finished. In this model, you're only charged for the CPU time used while your function runs.

Functions can be either stateless or stateful. When they're stateless (the default), they behave as if they're restarted every time they respond to an event. When they're stateful (called Durable Functions), a context is passed through the function to track prior activity.

Azure virtual networks and virtual subnets enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers. Azure virtual networks provide the following key networking capabilities:

Isolation and segmentation
Internet communications
Communicate between Azure resources
Communicate with on-premises resources
Route network traffic
Filter network traffic
Connect virtual networks

Azure virtual network allows you to create multiple isolated virtual networks. When you set up a virtual network, you define a private IP address space by using either public or private IP address ranges. The IP range only exists within the virtual network and isn't internet routable. You can divide that IP address space into subnets and allocate part of the defined address space to each named subnet.

 * VPN: a VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway. Azure VPN Gateway instances are deployed in a dedicated subnet of the virtual network and enable the following connectivity:

 - Connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a site-to-site connection.
 - Connect individual devices to virtual networks through a point-to-site connection.
 - Connect virtual networks to other virtual networks through a network-to-network connection.
You can deploy only one VPN gateway in each virtual network. However, you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations, which includes other virtual networks or on-premises datacenters.

ExpressRoute: Connectivity can be from an any-to-any (IP VPN) network, a point-to-point Ethernet network, or a virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a colocation facility. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet. This allows ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, faster speeds, consistent latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet.

 * Storage:
Azure Storage always stores multiple copies of your data so that it's protected from planned and unplanned events such as transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and natural disasters.
 - Locally redundant storage (LRS) replicates your data three times within a single data center in the primary region.
 - For Availability Zone-enabled Regions, zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your Azure Storage data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region.
 - GRS copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region (the region pair) using LRS.
 - GZRS combines the high availability provided by redundancy across availability zones with protection from regional outages provided by geo-replication. Data in a GZRS storage account is copied across three Azure availability zones in the primary region (similar to ZRS) and is also replicated to a secondary geographic region, using LRS, for protection from regional disasters.

 * Azure Blobs
Azure Blob storage is an object storage solution for the cloud. It can store massive amounts of data, such as text or binary data. Azure Blob storage is unstructured, meaning that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold. Azure Storage offers different access tiers for your blob storage, helping you store object data in the most cost-effective manner. The available access tiers include:
 - Hot access tier: Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently (for example, images for your website).
 - Cool access tier: Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (for example, invoices for your customers).
 - Cold access tier: Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 90 days.
 - Archive access tier: Appropriate for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency requirements (for example, long-term backups).

 * Azure Files
Azure File storage offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) or Network File System (NFS) protocols. Azure Files file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments. 

 * Azure Queues
Azure Queue storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages. Once stored, you can access the messages from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS.

 * Azure Disks
Azure Disk storage, or Azure managed disks, are block-level storage volumes managed by Azure for use with Azure VMs.

 * Azure Tables
Azure Table storage stores large amounts of structured data. Azure tables are a NoSQL datastore that accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud. Azure tables are ideal for storing structured, non-relational data

 * Azure Migrate
Azure Migrate is a service that helps you migrate from an on-premises environment to the cloud. Azure Migrate functions as a hub to help you manage the assessment and migration of your on-premises datacenter to Azure. It provides the following:
 - Unified migration platform: A single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure.
 - Range of tools: A range of tools for assessment and migration. Azure Migrate tools include Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment and Azure Migrate: Server Migration. Azure Migrate also integrates with other Azure services and tools, and with independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.
 - Assessment and migration: In the Azure Migrate hub, you can assess and migrate your on-premises infrastructure to Azure.

 * Azure Data Box
Azure Data Box is a physical migration service that helps transfer large amounts of data in a quick, inexpensive, and reliable way. The secure data transfer is accelerated by shipping you a proprietary Data Box storage device that has a maximum usable storage capacity of 80 terabytes. The Data Box is transported to and from your datacenter via a regional carrier.
Once the data from your import order is uploaded to Azure, the disks on the device are wiped clean in accordance with NIST 800-88r1 standards. For an export order, the disks are erased once the device reaches the Azure datacenter.

 * Azure File Sync
Azure File Sync is a tool that lets you centralize your file shares in Azure Files and keep the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of a Windows file server. It’s almost like turning your Windows file server into a miniature content delivery network. Once you install Azure File Sync on your local Windows server, it will automatically stay bi-directionally synced with your files in Azure.
With Azure File Sync, you can:
 - Use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS.
 - Have as many caches as you need across the world.
 - Replace a failed local server by installing Azure File Sync on a new server in the same datacenter.
 - Configure cloud tiering so the most frequently accessed files are replicated locally, while infrequently accessed files are kept in the cloud until requested.

 * Azure directory services
Microsoft Entra ID is a directory service that enables you to sign in and access both Microsoft cloud applications and cloud applications that you develop. Microsoft Entra ID can also help you maintain your on-premises Active Directory deployment. Microsoft Entra ID provides services such as:
 - Authentication: This includes verifying identity to access applications and resources. It also includes providing functionality such as self-service password reset, multifactor authentication, a custom list of banned passwords, and smart lockout services.
 - Single sign-on: Single sign-on (SSO) enables you to remember only one username and one password to access multiple applications. A single identity is tied to a user, which simplifies the security model. As users change roles or leave an organization, access modifications are tied to that identity, which greatly reduces the effort needed to change or disable accounts.
 - Application management: You can manage your cloud and on-premises apps by using Microsoft Entra ID. Features like Application Proxy, SaaS apps, the My Apps portal, and single sign-on provide a better user experience.
 - Device management: Along with accounts for individual people, Microsoft Entra ID supports the registration of devices. Registration enables devices to be managed through tools like Microsoft Intune. It also allows for device-based Conditional Access policies to restrict access attempts to only those coming from known devices, regardless of the requesting user account.

Microsoft Entra Connect synchronizes user identities between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. Microsoft Entra Connect synchronizes changes between both identity systems, so you can use features like SSO, multifactor authentication, and self-service password reset under both systems.

Microsoft Entra Domain Services is a service that provides managed domain services such as domain join, group policy, lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP), and Kerberos/NTLM authentication. Just like Microsoft Entra ID lets you use directory services without having to maintain the infrastructure supporting it, with Microsoft Entra Domain Services, you get the benefit of domain services without the need to deploy, manage, and patch domain controllers (DCs) in the cloud. Microsoft Entra Domain Services integrates with your existing Microsoft Entra tenant. This integration lets users sign into services and applications connected to the managed domain using their existing credentials. You can also use existing groups and user accounts to secure access to resources. These features provide a smoother lift-and-shift of on-premises resources to Azure.

Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication is a Microsoft service that provides multifactor authentication capabilities. Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication enables users to choose an additional form of authentication during sign-in, such as a phone call or mobile app notification.

Passwordless authentication needs to be set up on a device before it can work. For example, your computer is something you have. Once it’s been registered or enrolled, Azure now knows that it’s associated with you. Now that the computer is known, once you provide something you know or are (such as a PIN or fingerprint), you can be authenticated without using a password. Microsoft global Azure and Azure Government offer the following three passwordless authentication options that integrate with Microsoft Entra ID:
 - Windows Hello for Business
 - Microsoft Authenticator app
 - FIDO2 security keys

Windows Hello for Business is ideal for information workers that have their own designated Windows PC. The biometric and PIN credentials are directly tied to the user's PC, which prevents access from anyone other than the owner.
You can also allow your employee's phone to become a passwordless authentication method. You may already be using the Microsoft Authenticator App as a convenient multifactor authentication option in addition to a password. You can also use the Authenticator App as a passwordless option.
FIDO2 security keys are an unphishable standards-based passwordless authentication method that can come in any form factor. Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is an open standard for passwordless authentication. FIDO allows users and organizations to leverage the standard to sign-in to their resources without a username or password by using an external security key or a platform key built into a device. Users can register and then select a FIDO2 security key at the sign-in interface as their main means of authentication. These FIDO2 security keys are typically USB devices, but could also use Bluetooth or NFC. With a hardware device that handles the authentication, the security of an account is increased as there's no password that could be exposed or guessed.

Conditional Access is a tool that Microsoft Entra ID uses to allow (or deny) access to resources based on identity signals. These signals include who the user is, where the user is, and what device the user is requesting access from. Conditional Access also provides a more granular multifactor authentication experience for users. For example, a user might not be challenged for second authentication factor if they're at a known location. However, they might be challenged for a second authentication factor if their sign-in signals are unusual or they're at an unexpected location. During sign-in, Conditional Access collects signals from the user, makes decisions based on those signals, and then enforces that decision by allowing or denying the access request or challenging for a multifactor authentication response.

Zero Trust is a security model that assumes the worst case scenario and protects resources with that expectation. Zero Trust assumes breach at the outset, and then verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Traditionally, corporate networks were restricted, protected, and generally assumed safe. Only managed computers could join the network, VPN access was tightly controlled, and personal devices were frequently restricted or blocked. The Zero Trust model flips that scenario. Instead of assuming that a device is safe because it’s within the corporate network, it requires everyone to authenticate. Then grants access based on authentication rather than location.
